        **Be aware that NVM for Windows feature development is currently [frozen](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki/Runtime#nvm4w-feature-freeze).** We are actively developing [Runtime](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki/Runtime), a new JavaScript runtime manager to succeed NVM4W.

        Feature requests submitted here will be considered for Runtime. For more information, see the [new features explanation](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki/New-Features).

        If you are requesting an nvm-sh feature, please recognize that it is a different project from NVM4W (nvm-windows). For more about feature parity, see [Why Aren't Some nvm for macOS/Linux Features Supported?](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki/Common-Issues#why-isnt-nvmrc-supported-why-arent-some-nvm-for-macoslinux-features-supported)
