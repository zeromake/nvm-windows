        ## Before submitting your issue, please do the following:

        1. Make sure you're running Windows. If you're using macOS, Linux, WSL/WSL2, or a Docker container using Linux, then you probably want [nvm-sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (this is NVM _for Windows_).
        1. **Run `nvm debug` (v1.1.11+) to see if you can resolve your issue yourself.**
        1. Review the **[common issues and resolutions](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki/Common-Issues)** wiki page.
        1. **Search existing issues to see if your issue has already been opened/closed (help prevent duplicates).**
        1. Remember, there is a [wiki](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki) that answers questions about installation types, building from source, and project philosophy concerns.
        1. **[Read the README](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)**. We took the time to write it for you. Many people ignore this.
        1. If your issue is actually a question, please use the [discussions page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/discussions) so the whole community can help.
        1. If you're seeking commercial help or requesting something you really need _for work/employment_, please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/coreybutler) the change/fix.
